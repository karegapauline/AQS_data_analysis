# Mazingira day and what it should mean to us as Kenyans: The Air Quality and Health part

Last Friday, October 10th, Kenya celebrated Mazingira Day. A day usually marked by planting trees mostly. But it should be much more; it should be filled with education on what our environmental issues look like now, how we can protect them better, highlight amazing things we have done over the year, and all that. At least for us as AQS dealing with air quality, it should be. 
Our environment is important, and now more than ever, we need to take better care of it and be informed about how to do so. So we thought as AQS-EA, we could tell you about air quality in Kenya and give you a glimpse at the ins and outs in Kenya, so that you know.

TL; DR: This blog has a brief history of air quality in Kenya, how it is linked to health, the current status of what is being done about air quality and health in Kenya, its links to general climate change and health in Kenya, and some links to some valuable resources to stay in touch.
