# Mazingira Day and what it should mean to us as Kenyans: The Air Quality and Health part

Last Friday, October 10th, Kenya celebrated Mazingira Day. A day usually marked by planting trees mostly. But it should be much more; it should be filled with education on what our environmental issues look like now, how we can protect them better, highlight amazing things we have done over the year, and all that. At least for us, as AQS dealing with air quality, it should be. 
Our environment is important, and now more than ever, we need to take better care of it and be informed about how to do so. So, as AQS-EA, we are going to tell you about air quality in Kenya and give you a glimpse of the ins and outs, so that you know.

TL; DR: This blog has a brief history of air quality in Kenya, how it is linked to health, the current status of what is being done about air quality and health in Kenya, its links to general climate change and health in Kenya, and some links to some valuable resources to stay in touch.  

## Some basics
Air pollution is 

When we measure air pollution, we look at particulate matter (PM), PM1, PM2.5, and PM10. Then we have volatile organic compounds, which can come from various sources. The gaseous components include NO2, NOx, CO, SO2, black carbon, and several others. 

These are emmissions from everyday activities and we come into contact with them quite often. 

### What are the sources of air pollution?

Let's narrow it down to Kenya. We have industries such as cement, battery, jua kali sectors, chemical plants, murram roads, second hand cars and machinery that run on sulfur based fuels, both at home and at work places, ships on the coast, and more. All of these contribute to pollutants. We also cook with firewood, charcoal, and gas cookers, which also contribute various pollutants.

When we examine air pollution, we consider it from two angles: indoor or household air pollution (HAP, or IAP) and ambient air quality or pollution (outside air). 

The WHO and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have established standards indicating the limits of air quality. If these limits are exceeded, the air is no longer safe to breathe. The Air Quality Index is an indicator developed to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is and how polluted it is forecasted to become. For Kenya, PM2.5 should not exceed an average of 15mg/m3 in 24 hours, or 5 annually. 

So what happens when they exceed these levels? 

### Health implications of poor air quality
There are short-term effects, such as eye irritation, sneezing, and a runny nose. Think of what happens on a super dusty day. Or when you are exposed to a lot of smoke from, for example, charcoal, or wood when cooking, or when burning waste. 

Long-term effects include asthma, cardiovascular issues, cancer, and neuro developmental issues in children. 

## How are these pollutants measured to know what levels are dangerous 


## A brief history of air quality management in Kenya
The air quality space has been active for years; we have publications dating back to 2001, but these were scientific research studies, and we assume they were meant for a more scientific audience. Engagement of the general public through media, such as newspaper articles, became more rampant in the 2010s, coinciding with visible government actions and a general presence on the subject during the same period. In 2014, the national government established air quality regulations, setting standards for pollutants(reference 1). This regulations act is what is still being implemented to date. Thanks to this regulation, noticeable issues such as the lack of air quality data became apparent. 

There are multiple studies being done on indoor air quality. There has been a surge in campaigns to promote cleaner cooking energy such as JikoKoa, and more.

The transport sector is also a key player in this history. Over the years, there has been introduction of laws that regulate the age of vehicles that can be imported which significantly affect the air quality. There has been a surge in efforts to introduce electric transport vehicles, and motor cycles. 




## Status of Air Quality in Kenya
You might be asking, where is it safest to breathe, and where do I need to watch out?

## What part can you play?
Yes, planting a tree will make a huge difference, so as is customary for the day, please do so. But you can also do the following:
1. Wear a mask on dusty days
2. Your choice of cooking method should be safe to use. There are multiple campaigns to promote the use of safe cooking fuels like JikoKoa, LPG use as opposed to the traditional use of coal and firewood.
3. Transport means. Import or buy better second hand vehicles
4. Invest in air quality monitoring instruments
5. Educate yourself about laws and rules like the EMCR, transport laws, urban planning and regulation laws. to become an advocate for your local community by questioning and reporting practices that could cause harm in the places you frequent.
