# Mazingira Day and What It Should Mean to Us as Kenyans: The Air Quality and Health Part

Last Friday, October 10th, Kenya celebrated Mazingira Day. A day usually marked by tree planting — an important tradition — but it should be much more. It should be filled with education on our environmental realities, how we can take better care of our surroundings, spotlight the environmental successes we’ve achieved over the year, and inspire collective responsibility.

For us at **AQS-EA**, working daily in air quality, this day should also be about understanding the air we breathe and the impact it has on our health, economy, and future.

Our environment is important, and now more than ever, we must take better care of it — and be informed about how to do so. So, as AQS-EA, we want to tell you about air quality in Kenya and give you a simple but meaningful glimpse into the ins and outs of the topic.

**TL;DR:**
This blog covers a brief history of air quality in Kenya, how it connects to health, the current state of air quality management, its links to climate change, and helpful resources on how you can stay informed and involved.

## Some Basics: What Is Air Pollution?

Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the air — chemicals, particles, or biological materials — that pose risks to human health and the environment.

When measuring air pollution, we look mainly at:

* **Particulate Matter (PM)**: PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 — tiny particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs.
* **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)**: From fuels, paints, cleaning products, and industrial processes.
* **Gaseous pollutants**:

  * **Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂)**
  * **Nitrogen oxides (NOₓ)**
  * **Carbon monoxide (CO)**
  * **Sulfur dioxide (SO₂)**
  * **Ozone (O₃)**
  * **Black carbon**

These pollutants come from everyday activities — transport, cooking, energy use, waste burning, and industrial processes — which means we encounter them far more often than many people realize.

## What Are the Sources of Air Pollution in Kenya?

Let’s bring it home.

Kenya’s major pollution sources include:

* **Industries**: Cement factories, metal works, battery recycling, chemical plants.
* **Transport**: Imported second-hand vehicles, motorcycles, matatus, and trucks running on high-sulphur fuel.
* **Jua Kali sector**: Welding, spray painting, metalwork, all often done without emissions control.
* **Road dust**: Especially from **murram roads** and construction sites.
* **Ports and shipping**: Particularly around the Coast.
* **Household energy**: Firewood, charcoal, kerosene, and even gas stoves.
* **Waste burning**: Still common in many estates and rural areas.

Air pollution is generally viewed from two angles:

1. **Household/Indoor Air Pollution (HAP or IAP)** — especially around cooking, heating, and poorly ventilated spaces.
2. **Ambient (Outdoor) Air Pollution** — what we breathe outside.

The **WHO** and **EPA** provide global guidelines for safe air quality levels. Kenya’s own regulation, for example, sets the standard for **PM2.5 at 15 µg/m³ (24-hr average)** and **5 µg/m³ (annual average)**.

So what happens when levels exceed these limits?

## Health Implications of Poor Air Quality

**Short-term effects:**

* Eye irritation
* Sneezing and coughing
* Throat irritation
* Headaches
* Breathing difficulty
  Think of how you feel on a very dusty day, or when exposed to kitchen smoke or burning waste.

**Long-term effects:**

* Asthma
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Cardiovascular disease
* Stroke
* Lung cancer
* Cognitive and neurodevelopmental issues in children
* Premature death

Air pollution is not just an “environment” issue — it is one of the **biggest public health threats globally and in Kenya**, affecting pregnant mothers, young children, people living near busy roads, industrial workers, and communities relying on solid fuels.

## How Do We Measure Pollutants and Know What Levels Are Dangerous?

Pollutants are measured using **air quality monitors** — instruments that continuously sample and analyze the air. These include:

* **Reference-grade monitors**: Highly accurate but expensive; often used by government and research institutions.
* **Low-cost sensors**: Cheaper, increasingly reliable, and ideal for community-level monitoring (e.g., PurpleAir, Clarity).
* **Satellite monitoring**: Provides nationwide trends and fills gaps where ground monitors are absent.
* **Mobile monitoring**: Sensors mounted on cars, motorcycles, or drones.

The measurements are translated into indices like the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** so that the public can easily understand whether the air is safe.

This is where Kenya still has gaps: *monitoring coverage remains limited*, meaning many communities do not know what they are breathing daily.

## A Brief History of Air Quality Management in Kenya

Kenya’s air quality journey has evolved significantly:

* **Early 2000s**: Scientific publications focused on industrial emissions and indoor air pollution.
* **2010s**: Public engagement increased via newspapers, environmental campaigns, and civil society reports.
* **2014**: The national government enacted the **Environmental Management and Coordination (Air Quality) Regulations (EMCR 2014)** — the country’s first formal standards for pollutants.
  This exposed major gaps: *insufficient monitoring, weak enforcement, and lack of public awareness*.

Since then:

* Clean cooking campaigns (e.g., JikoKoa, PayGo LPG solutions) have expanded.
* Efforts to electrify transport — e-bodas, e-buses, e-delivery bikes — have grown.
* Research on indoor air pollution has increased significantly.
* Counties such as Nairobi, Kisumu, and Mombasa are exploring air monitoring partnerships.

Kenya is making progress, but challenges around data availability, policy implementation, and public awareness remain.

## Status of Air Quality in Kenya

You might ask: **Where is it safest to breathe, and where should we be more cautious?**

Air quality varies dramatically by region.
Generally:

* **Urban areas** — Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru — face higher pollution levels due to traffic, industries, and population density.
* **Informal settlements** tend to experience extremely high household air pollution due to solid fuels.
* **Rural areas** may have cleaner outdoor air but still struggle with indoor pollution from firewood and charcoal.

## What Part Can You Play?

Planting a tree makes a difference — so please do that. But there’s more:

1. **Wear a mask on dusty days**, especially if you walk or commute along major roads.
2. **Choose cleaner cooking methods.** Consider LPG, improved cookstoves, or electric cookers when possible.
3. **Make smarter transport choices.**

   * Buy vehicles with better emission standards.
   * Maintain your car — poor maintenance equals more emissions.
   * Support e-mobility if accessible in your area.
4. **Invest in or support community air quality monitoring.**
   Even low-cost sensors help create awareness and push local action.
5. **Learn the laws that protect you**, such as the EMCR and urban planning regulations.
   Use this knowledge to question harmful practices in your estate, workplace, or school.
6. **Avoid burning waste** — report repeated violators to local authorities.
7. **Talk about air quality.** Awareness is the first step to change.
